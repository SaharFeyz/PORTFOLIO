      <h3>CONCEPT SUMMARY</h3>
      <p>The idea addresses the presence of harmful ingredients in skin-lightening products
        and how this is still promoted by the beauty industry because lighter-skinned people
        are seen as better than darker-skinned people, especially with women in
        third-world countries. These women tend to consume a lot of skin lightening
        products in an attempt to change their skin color which will continue to
        benefit the skin-lightening industry. With some lightening creams,
        there are potential side effects as they may contain high levels of
        hydroquinone and mercury that lead to skin problems such as blisters and acne.</p>

      <h3>OUR PRODUCT</h3>
      <p><em class="keywords">Physical &mdash;</em> The product is a set of skin-lightening creams with variety of scents,
        containing hydroquinone and with different concentrations of Kojic acid (known to lighten skin as well).
        The concentration is derived through the Blighten-lab’s app feature (B-lighten lab + 23andMe)
        where it personalizes your dosage based on your genetics result. It predicts how light
        your skin should be based on your white-passing genetics and recommends the right
        product to achieve that look.</p>
      <p><em class="keywords">Digital &mdash;</em> The app flow lets the user browse through current products as well as explore
        the 23andMe feature, get their sample in and receive their results.
        The recommendations based on their results can then be purchased on the app.</p>

      <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing packages and products that are believable and provocative, yet they reflect the Critical Design
        strategy with subtle details that addresses the beauty standards issue
        </li>
        <li>Designing a consistent branding for the products
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>SOLUTIONS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Thinking through personalizing the products by taking consumer's personal data such as name, skin tone information, and genetic information when they use the app.
        Also, partnership with 23 and me to take the genetic information seemed a decent idea to overcome the challenge of
        making the product provocative, controversial and believable commercial product.
        </li>
        <li>Using the idea of gathering data and reflect that on the products, such as suggesting the dosage of bleaching chemicals for the skin,
        engraving the name of the consumer on the box, as well as printing the picture of the consumer’s face before and after using the bleaching creams
        on the package, were helpful choices to overcome the challenges.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h3>EARLY EXPLORATION</h3>
        <p><em class="keywords">Part One &mdash;</em> The early idea was to develop a set of make-up products that was focusing on showing the gross (e.g. animal fats)/danger (e.g. dangerous chemicals)
          side of what is inside the makeup that target women especially in the third world countries where make-up use is heavy.
          One example of this cosmetic set (EYESHADOW KIT) shows the harmful material used in cosmetics but they are covered
          by beautiful names that are associated with soft and good feelings.
        </p>
        <p><em class="keywords">Part Two &mdash;</em> Continuous usage of bleaching creams are known to damage the skin especially when daily application isn’t controlled,
          and by having the app encourages its users in a subtle way,
          creating a dependence on the product even when they experience skin damage, it forces them to realize this product only contains
          harmful substances that will manifest in the long term.
        </p>
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The objective is to produce concise and clear conceptualizations of ideas and design statements for the project;
            compose and create proposals that effectively use a speculative design strategy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Feedback from teaching staff</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your concept has a lot of potential to offer critique on a couple of different issues
            (the beauty industry and self-acceptance, racism, etc).

        <h3>SECOND EXPLORATION</h3>
        <p>Welcome to our DIY skin care home recipe. Based on the taste you have chosen, the app suggests ingredients
          that you can find in your home easily
          and mix it with the base cream that you need to order from the app. Then, you will add those ingredients at
          home with the base cream and have your organic natural DIY lightening cream in your hands.
        </p>
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The objectives are to research related design concepts to further develop our own concept and to demonstrate that
            we know related design work to our concept; to demonstrate that we have explored the design space and alternative approaches;
            to demonstrate that we have explored the aspects of form, materials, technical approaches and interactions as it relates to our concept.

        <h3>WORK-IN-PROGRESS</h3>
        <p>In this phase the concept is almost finalized and many improvements have been made in the prototypes.
          The prototypes are very close to the final design in this state, but there are still some changes
          that have been made in the final design.
        </p>
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The objectives are to compose and create a work-in-progress that potentially uses a speculative design strategy effectively;
            specify clear and concise design commitments, provocation, and strategy demonstrated in the work;
            and for students to appraise and critique others' work constructively.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Feedback from teaching staff</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Overall, you have made great progress on this project. Your framing is strong and the issue that you are aiming to engage
            with in your speculative design is important and provocative. It is also clear that your team has put in a lot of work into
            considering the details of your design. So, it feels like you are on the right track to have a powerful project.
            You have a lot of well-considered design elements, but think about how you can highlight the right aspects to tell the full story.

        <h3>FINAL DESIGN</h3>
        <p>In the final design, we decided to eliminate the lightening cream for the baby, and focus more on the personalization
            of the product and how the app can entice the consumer to make the right decision for purchasing the creams.
            For the final product, I designed a personalized box that had the name of the consumer engraved on the lid,
            ribbons wrapping around the box lid with the name of the consumer printed on them, including the picture of
            the consumer indicating before and after using the lightening cream products, on the side of each lightening
            cream box in the package. The final form with more sophisticated design resulted in a more effective and successful project.
        </p>
        <h4>Graphical design decisions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
          Color coded packages for each dosage and the type of creams
          </li>
          <li>
          Using the flower illustration of the cream scent on the boxes to enhance the visibility and faster recognition
          </li>
          <li>
          Using large numbers (1, 2, 3) on the side of each set of creams to indicate the order of usage
          </li>
          <li>
          Using visual hierarchical clustering of the information
          </li>
          <li>
          Logo is simple, gradient and wavy conveys a soft feeling and has beauty and soft skin products connotation

          <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
          <p>Feedback from teaching staff: Your final exhibition showed further improvement over your work last week in the final design debate.
          The addition of the beauty shots really caught people's attention and you were able to talk about your project
          in character. Several exhibition attendees from outside of our class found your project provocative and contentious — which was fantastic to see.
          Your work provoked people to confront the critique set forth in the world projected through your design to the point that some found it upsetting.
          You did a great job at bringing in existing elements to reframe and bring attention to critical issues. This was a nuanced and challenging design process,
          and in the end you delivered a quality project.
          </p>
          <h3>TAKEAWAYS</h3>
          <p>The entire process of this project was very enjoyable, and the design approach we used worked well for the context.
            I learned a lot from this project, and how choosing the right design strategy, in this case critical design,
            can significantly change the impact of a design. Throughout the project, I was able to understand, interpret,
            and think about future and existing designs. Also, I learned theoretical perspectives of speculative design,
            methods for creating flexible and innovative designs of the future, and techniques for critiquing culture and design.
