      <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <p>The FlashLite is designed specifically for senior citizens with arthritis.
        Since arthritis causes pain in oneâ€™s finger joints, some seniors will avoid
        using products that require finger-bending actions, such as grasping or pushing buttons.
        The FlashLite allows seniors with arthritis to comfortably use its functions without having
        to worry about the limitations of their dexterity.</p>
      <h3>MY MAJOR ROLES</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sketch and ideation of the initial concept</li>
        <li>Rendeting the 3D digital model</li>
        <li>Researching the persona</li>
        <li>Design the poster</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing the best grip without reinforcing the users to bend their fingers</li>
        <li>Designing a button that doesn't require the force of a finger to turn on and off</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>RESEARCHING TARGET AUDIENCE</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Researching about how individuals with arthritis are more comfortable with interaction by their hands</li>
        <li>Understanding the limitation, frustration, and goal of these individuals</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>PERSONA DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Name: Mary</li>
        <li>Age: 65</li>
        <li>Mary is retired and suffers from arthritis. Her pain point is that she cannot perform certain tasks comfortably due to her arthritis. Her goal is to be able to do tasks on her own regardless of her capabilities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>INITIAL CONCEPT</h3>
      <p>The initial concept of the form focused on the concavity of the hand placements
        and shape of the switch, so it was developed based on the needs of the individuals with arthritis.</p>

      <h3>2ND ITERATION</h3>
      <p>In order to increase the grip between hands and flash light,
          I made the handles more concave in the second iteration.</p>
      <h4>Challenge</h4>
      <p>Developing an idea of a flashlight that doesn't require any
          finger bending and force.</p>
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>Utilizing side of the hands and palms to do the interaction instead of
          designing primarily for interactions done by fingers.</p>

      <h3>PHYSICAL PROTOTYPE</h3>
      <p>I used foam to create this prototype and it involved a lot of sanding to
        create a smooth surface and the desired curve on the button. The smooth
          concave sides of the light provide additional grip for the user.
          The light is operated with a large, hand-width button that is easily pushed with the palm.

      <h3>DIGITAL RENDER</h3>
      <p>For 3D rendering I used SolidWorks, and since this flashlight is hygienically-focused,
        I used texture materials that correspond to this demand.
        I used Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, or ABS, as the texture
        of the main body of the flashlight since it is a thermoplastic
        polymer that can be easily cleaned, making it a good choice for a health-focused product.</p>
        <h4>Challenges and Solution</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Finding textures that look realistic and corresponds to what the user need on a
          daily basis use.</li>
          <li>Trying out multiple different textures and researching about the materials
          that are light weight as well as being hygienic.</li>
        </ul>

  <div class="box_description general_description">
    <div>
      <h4>ANALYSIS</h4>
      <p>The final design met the expectations, and received an excellent grade. However, because this project didn't
        require a polished physical prototype with final materials, there will be opportunities
        to improve some flaws if there was a final physical prototype.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>TAKEAWAYS</h4>
      <p>The material of the products makes a lot of difference in the look and feel
      of the products as well as their functionality. Also, this project taught me
      to think out of the box and look at the real needs of different individuals for product design.</p>
