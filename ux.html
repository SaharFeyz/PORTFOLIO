            It employs design-driven, design thinking, effective use of technology as a media, that addresses a core business problem to find an
            opportunity to intervene, and importantly is after unique and memorable outcomes. For this project, our team chose Arc'teryx,
            specifically Veilance, to improve the Veilance visibility and importance of its innovative fabrications to the potential consumers
            in its website. The interesting outcome of this project, which was done in Fall 2017, is that after our team proposed the final
            digital prototype, the similar main changes that we proposed, has been taken place in Arc'teryx actual website in 2020. In its
            main landing page, Arc'teryx has added a link to Veilance webpage, and an Editorial section has been separately added to emphasize
            more intriguing information about the product for more customer engagement.

          The evaluations that we could consider were: heuristic evaluation, usability study, controlled study, affective evaluation, field deployment.
