      <h3>CONCEPT SUMMARY</h3>
      <p>The concept is to provide efficiency and convenience for
        individuals' self-training to engage them to do the
        exercise correctly. Healthy individuals can use it to
        perform bicep weight lifting, and patients with wrist
        joint issues can use it to do wrist rehab exercises
        without assistance from others. The LED lights will
        guide users and help them to maintain a good posture,
        which is made to prevent wrists and arms injuries from
        exercising with heavyweights in incorrect gestures.

      <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Coming up with an innovative concept for body interface that is meaningful and interesting interaction, and has clear affordances with minimal instructions.</li>
        <li>Making a working wireless prototype that doesnâ€™t break apart when it is tested in the final showcase.</li>
        <li>Sewing the conductive thread in a way that it entirely works for LEDs and Sensors so that it conducts electricity without any disruption.</li>
        <li>Debugging the code</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>SOLUTIONS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Brainstorming a few concepts and evaluating to see which one exceeds the expectations.</li>
        <li>Finding a container that can hold the sewn circuit.</li>
        <li>Sewing multiple times until the circuit works entirely.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>DIGITAL TOOLS USED</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Arduino</li>
        <li>Adafruit electronic kit</li>

      <h3 class="heading-1">INTERACTION & USER EXPERIENCE</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-style">The Smart Dumbbell has dual functionality. Its LEDs are the main indicators of the correct and incorrect movements (orientation/position/pace) of the hand and arm. If the user holds the dumbbell in a straight position and moves it up slowly and straight, the two LEDs on the sides remain green. Also, with this correct movement and pace, the pink LEDs, which are located between the two green LEDs, will light up one by one. Otherwise, the side LEDs will turn red one at a time depending on the position. If the dumbbell is tilted too much to the left, the left LED will turn red; if the dumbbell is tilted too much to the right, the right LED will turn red. The correct movement for the rehab purpose is to move the wrist straight up and down slowly without any arm lifting and rotation. And for the weight lifting purpose, the correct movement is to moving the forearm straight up and down around the elbow.</p>

  <div class="box_description general_description">
    <div>
      <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
      <p>The final product received the highest grade in the entire class projects, since it was intuitive, creative, meaningful and it met all the requirements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Takes Advantage of Physical Affordances</li>
        <li>Offers Virtual Affordances</li>
        <li>Requires minimal instructions to use effectively</li>
        <li>Shares an interesting movement</li>
        <li>Uses at least 2 sensors, one continuous mapping and at least one discrete mapping</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>TAKEAWAYS</h3>
      <p>I was able to develop an interesting concept and design an artistic interface by analyzing models of bodily
        interactions with machines and applying the concept to a representational project.
