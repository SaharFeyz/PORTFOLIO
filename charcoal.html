        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <p>The overall functionality and sketch process of the project was done successfully,
          and the project met the expectations. However, due to limited time we were not able to
          create a .html webpage for all the products, links, and buttons, in fact it was not required.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Takeaways</h4>
        <p>Sketching and wireframing was an essential part of this project,
          and it really helped to simplify the flow of the website in the coding phase.
        </p>
        <p>Understanding the importance of ARIA role attributes in code for increasing the accessibility of the website, and creating a user-centered design.
