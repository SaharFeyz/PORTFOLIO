          The form factor must be fitted or
          worn so that it can provide imagery directly to the eyes. It must allow a mobile phone (iPhone or Android) to be embedded in the form factor securely.
          The device must deliver supply audio from the phone (in the form of headphones or similar) to the user. The form factor must also allow
          stereoscopic lenses to be fitted inside. The form factor must be constructed of specific materials; common and uncommon from a list
          (fabric and wood for our team). The fitting of the device must be such that it is adjustable as a wearable/appendage.
          The device must conform to our team's chosen user persona, and the SIAT logo must be located prominently on the form factor.

          This project was done in two phases, 1st was individual and 2nd was in group. The first phase required each team member to pick one user group (one for each team member):
          Construction worker, Elderly person with arthritis in their hands and wrists, and 6 year-old child. We had to explain the relationship between the
          ergonomic requirements and create ergonomic blue foam models. In the second phase, one foam flashlight was chosen in the critique session and by
          adding one of the following constraints, Rugged, durable, State of the art/high tech, Environmentally friendly/ecological, Desirable for children,
          and Hygienic and easy to clean, we had to research the material, 3D render the final product, and explain it in a poster.

          While working creatively we had to be sure to have photo-realism as the end goal. Students we asked to create two composites based off of renders of the environment.
          Projects must have at least 1 main object occupying the scene, and complexity of the created environment, and the photo-realism of the end composites were the main factors.
