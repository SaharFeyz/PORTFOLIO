    <div>
      <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <p>The interactive system that we focused on this project is a home-based gardening mobile app that its
        goal is to help novice gardeners, people whom are interested in learning how to raise one or more plants
        for varied personal reasons (e.g. want to have a simple house plant, want to grow vegetables for home consumption,
        want to be more responsible, etc.), or those who have little experience in doing so and/or do not know where
        to start maintaining gardening as a hobby, to achieve their goal.

  </div>
  <div class="box_description general_description background">
    <div>
      <h3 class="heading-1">FIRST INTERACTIVE PROTOTYPE</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-style">This step required us to create a high-fidelity multilinear interactive prototype of our entire interactive system using
        Axure, Balsamiq, Origami, Framer, XD, HTML or other means. This prototype had to include every step and interaction that
        was part of the core path and core idea of the application at minimum.</p>
    </div>
  </div>  
  <div class="box_description">  
    <div>    
      <h4>Objective</h4>
      <p>We had to endeavour to complete as many other connected features as we could in order to have a broad range of interactions and user paths for testing.</p>
      <p>I used <strong>Sketch</strong> and <strong>Principle</strong> to prototype because of its flexibility and wide range of creativity options for the core interactions and micro-interaction.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Opportunities for improvement</h4>
      <p>Improving the interface by removing the still images, replacing them with illustrated icons, and using card style shapes for browsing the categories</p>
    </div>  
  </div>  
  <div class="box_description general_description">
    <div>     
      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="list-style-2">Working with Principle for the first time, lack of experience working with the software</li>
        <li class="list-style-2">Many unwanted animation transitions appeared in the prototype </li>
        <li class="list-style-2">Simplifying the interface yet having engaging micro-interactions</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div> 
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>I had to remove every single element in the artboard out of the group in order to prevent them from being automatically animated when a button was animated while tapping.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="box_description background">
    <div>
      <h3 class="heading-1">TESTING AND REFINING</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-style">This step required us to conduct user testing on three users. These could involve surveys and interviews, heuristic evaluations or other
        methods such as Think Aloud Testing, or Task Analysis. We tested our first prototype on three users. Our intention was to
        prompt them with a series of tasks, observe them, then ask a series of questions related to their ease of use and overall
        experience regarding our proposed user interface. We used a questionnaire that prompted users to perform an interaction task,
        and then fill out a few quick questions.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSfi91b0BkQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
  <div class="box_description">  
    <div>    
      <h4>Objective</h4>
      <p>This step was crucial to understand how easily the user can finish the assigned tasks and find out the overall experience and satisfaction with the user interface.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Opportunities for improvement</h4>
      <p>In the final week the interface must decrease the confusion of user about reminder and my garden to the minimum. Also, moving forward, the bottom menu will be updated to increase readability and visibility.</p>
    </div>  
  </div> 
  <div class="box_description general_description">
    <div>     
      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="list-style-2">The interface issues we found in user testing is that there is a disconnection between the hamburger menu and bottom menu. The more important features must be in the bottom menu to facilitate the process of locating Reminder and My garden.</li>
        <li class="list-style-2">These issues created frustration and confusion for the users, and slowed down their process.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div> 
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>Visually help users to recognize in the first place and make important functions apparent at almost every stage.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="box_description background">
    <div>
      <h3 class="heading-1">FINAL DESIGN</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-style">Finally, we had to provide an exceptional interface design with clear affordances, consistent visual language, exceptional micro-interactions, and a completed interface that resolves a problem exceptionally well for the intended user.</p>

      <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <p>Overall, the design met the expectations, and most of the feature designs and microinteractions were quite interesting and intuitive.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Takeaways</h4>
      <p>During this process, I was able to analyze requirements for an interface, identify design opportunities within a given scenario, and ideate design concepts based on them. Also, I learned to apply different design methods such as sketching, scenarios, storyboarding, and prototyping to achieve a user-centered and successful design. Then, evaluate and improve the interface design through multiple iterations.</p>
